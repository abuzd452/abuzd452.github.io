      <h1>Cassiopeia</h1>
      <h2>Myth</h2>
      <p>In mythology, Cassiopeia was the wife of King Cepheus
        (represented by the neighbouring constellation Cepheus 
        in the sky) of Ethiopia. Once, she boasted that she was 
        more beautiful than the Nereids. The Nereids were the 50 
        sea nymphs fathered by the Titan Nereus. They were enraged 
        by Cassiopeia’s comments and appealed to Poseidon to punish 
        Cassiopeia for her boastfulness. Poseidon was married to one 
        of the nymphs, Amphitrite. 
        The sea god obliged and sent Cetus, a sea monster represented 
        by the constellation Cetus (the Whale), located in the same region 
        of the sky, to ravage the coast of Cepheus’ kingdom. Cepheus turned 
        to an oracle for help and the oracle told him that, in order to appease 
        Poseidon, he and Cassiopeia had to sacrifice their daughter Andromeda to 
        the sea monster. Reluctantly, they did so, leaving Andromeda chained to a 
        rock for the monster to find. However, she was saved in the last minute by 
        the Greek hero Perseus, who happened to be passing by, saw Andromeda and rescued 
        her from the monster.</p>
